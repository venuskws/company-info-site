Honesty declaration:
This is the term assignment of our web programming course. I uploaded this as a demonstration of what I have been able to achieve through my study program.

I intentionally eliminated the course name because I do not wish for this to be found by students who would potentially copy my solution. As Iâ€™m still also a student, this could impact me as well. If you are a fellow student, please do not copy this assignment in any way. You are welcome to contact me for help instead.
